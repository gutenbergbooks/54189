<p>No world-peace is possible before peace in
Russia is re-established! Indeed, how can we
talk of universal peace when 180 million men
are still in the throes of a most disastrous and
terrible war, a war which leads, not to victory,
but to annihilation?</p>

<p>There will be no peace in the world if there
is no peace in Russia, for the boiling lava
in eruption may well submerge the whole of
Europe at any moment. That is why the Paris
Conference will remain powerless if it cannot
terminate the civil war in Russia. All that the
Conference has done and is doing at the present
time will be brought to nothing and will
be a waste of time unless a normal and peaceful
state of things is established in Eastern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
Europe. Until the Peace Conference has
settled these questions, humanity will continue
to be overshadowed by the menace of
such a catastrophe that the disasters of the
four years of war will appear in comparison
as mere child’s play.</p>

<h2 id="The_Paris_Conference_faced_by_the"><span class="smcap">The Paris Conference faced by the
Russian Sphinx</span></h2>

<p>The Peace Conference finds itself facing the
Russian sphinx, whose problems a mind of
western culture can neither comprehend nor
solve.</p>

<p>The agglomeration of heterogeneous peoples
in Russia leaves the ragged Hapsburg empire
far behind. In Russia you have the complicated
psychology of the Oriental, barely intelligible
to his western brother. You have also
the tangled economic questions and the centuries-old
crimes of corrupt governments, the
devastation of a world-war, and still more the
material and moral destruction brought about
by the awakening instincts of the half-barbaric
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
masses which call themselves Bolsheviki. And
all this is intermingling and boiling over in an
indescribable chaos which even the liveliest
imagination could not conceive.</p>

<h2 id="The_Representatives_of_Russia"><span class="smcap">The Representatives of Russia</span></h2>

<p>There is no lack of amateurs ready to solve
the riddle of the Russian sphinx. Each government
represented at the Peace Conference
possesses its own point of view on the Russian
question; each political party, each organ of
the Press has its own remedy for saving Russia.
Nor is that all, for there are Orientals who
have come to plead on behalf of their Fatherland
before the world’s Forum. Russia teems
with people and opinions, so each group of
the crowd assembled in Paris brings forward
a programme of salvation. There is the <span class="smcap">Russian
Political Conference</span>, consisting of
Sazonoff, Tzarist ex-Minister of Foreign
Affairs; the prince Lvoff, ex-Premier; Tchaikovsky,
President of the <span class="smcap">North Russian
Government</span>, and Maklakoff, ex-Ambassador
of Russia under the Provisional Government.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
This Conference has a theorist, an ex-director
of the Juridical Department of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of Russia under the Provisional
Government, M. Andr&eacute; Mandelstam, who has
published a series of pamphlets in which he
sets forth the theoretical and practical bases
of the views of the Russian Political Conference.
Outside this Conference, Kerensky, ex-Premier,
is busying himself; and with him,
Avksentieff, Zenzinoff, Argounoff, Rogovsky,
Minor, Sokoloff, Slonin, all members of the
All-Russian Constituent Assembly. We find
also the <span class="smcap">Paris Section for the Regeneration
of Russia</span> and the <span class="smcap">Russian Republican
League</span>. Add to these the representatives
of the government of Admiral Koltchak and
of General Denikin. From the South of Russia
comes Schreider, ex-mayor of Petrograd, at
present the president of the “Committee of
the South,” who was compelled to leave the
four other members of his delegation behind
on the Prinkipo island. Finally, to close the
name-list, there is A. N. Briantchaninoff,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>“Chairman of the Slav Congress in Moscow
and of the Russian National Committee in

London.” In the <i>Pages Modernes</i> are collaborating
Savinkoff, L. Andreeff, Strouve, etc.
Briefly, the Russian chaos is completely
enough represented, and the plans of salvation
are not lacking.</p>

<h2 id="Relations_Between_Russia_and_the"><span class="smcap">Relations Between Russia and the
Borderland Peoples</span></h2>

<p>The problems which the following pages
deal with are somewhat more modest in comparison
with the Russian imbroglio. They are
those concerning the so-called “borderland
peoples of Russia,” <i>i.e.</i>, nationalities which
have for a long time suffered under the Russian
domination, which have been relegated to
second and third class, and which, quite tired
of this intolerable position, are looking for a
better lot and greater possibility of development
in an independent national life, by means
of separation from Russia.</p>

<p>They have formed, for that purpose, a series
of small independent States desirous of getting
their independence recognised by the Peace
Conference, which, in solving the riddle of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
Russian sphinx, will have to pronounce the
decisive word on this question. Every one, be
he Russian or a representative of the nationalities,
is trying to solve this question in accordance
with his point of view. The aim of
the following pages is to elucidate it from the
point of view of Latvia.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<h2 id="Proposal_to_postpone_the_Solution_concerning"><span class="smcap">Proposal to postpone the Solution concerning
“the Borderland Peoples
of Russia”</span></h2>

<p>Let us first consider the proposals of the
<span class="smcap">Russian Political Conference</span>:&mdash;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>“The
question of the Russian borderland peoples
must be postponed until it can be decided

with the co-operation of the Russian people,
for the questions relating to the future status
of the nationalities included within the borders
of ancient Russia cannot be solved outside the
Russian people and without their consent.”
That is what the Russian Political Conference
proposed in its note of the 6th March,
1919&mdash;the solution of the problem must be
postponed as long as the Russian people is
not in a position to make its will fully known
and to take part in the settlement of these
questions.</p>

<p>Evidently perceiving how impossible this
proposal is, the Russian Political Conference
is considering a compromise, and proposes “to
apply in the meantime, before a definite
settlement is arrived at, a provisional r&eacute;gime
in accordance with the present necessities”
of the States that have separated themselves
from Russia, but “no definite solution should
intervene.” In other words, the Russian
Political Conference proposes to recognise the
<i>de facto</i> governments of the States detached
from Russia on the condition that, in an undetermined
future, the Russian people, expressing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
its will by the voice of the Constituent
Assembly or by other means, shall say the
final and decisive word.</p>

<h2 id="Practical_Consequences_of_the_Postponing"><span class="smcap">Practical Consequences of the Postponing
of the Question</span></h2>

<p>It is supremely clear that this compromise
of the Russian Political Conference would not
give any practical solution, either at the present
time or in the near future. The proof
of this is in Latvia’s desperate struggles on
two fronts&mdash;against the Bolsheviki who have
thrown themselves on her, and against the
German army of occupation which has no wish
at all to surrender the territory. In such circumstances,
of what importance would be the
recognition of the <i>de facto</i> situation? Moral
help is indispensable; besides, it is necessary
to have a solid juridical basis, recognised by
the Powers, in order to exact from the Bolsheviki
and the Germans, not another <i>de facto</i>
situation in the place of the one they have
caused, but the substitution of Right for their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
illegal tyranny. Without this, the success of
the struggle against the Bolsheviki and the
Germans would become impossible, or at least
more complicated. Consequently, arms and
munitions become indispensable. Were they
supplied by the governments backing up the
Letts, means for the equipment and maintenance
of the army would yet be lacking.
These means cannot be obtained if the country
does not provide its own finances, which in
turn cannot be established until the State
is judicially recognised. Strong in such a recognition,
the Lettish army, for instance,
would long since have occupied Riga and
delivered it from the Bolshevist tyranny, but
it simply dared not do it because of the lack
of revictualling for the inhabitants. Assuredly,
who would risk delivering goods on credit without
knowing who is legally responsible for the
debts? To be successful in the struggle it
would be indispensable to restore the means
of transport, the communications destroyed
by the Bolsheviki, and to replace the rolling
stock carried away by the Germans. But who
would concern himself with that and invest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
his capital in such an enterprise if there is no
one judicially responsible, and if one does not
know to whom the country is to belong and
who is to rule it in the future?</p>

<p>The recognition of the present situation
would in no way help the Lettish people to
hasten its resurrection, so that it represents no
progress towards the practical solution of the
question in dispute.</p>

<h2 id="It_is_doubtful_whether_the_Russian"><span class="smcap">It is doubtful whether the Russian
People will soon be in a Position to
participate in the Solution of these
Questions</span></h2>

<p>Of necessity, one could come to an agreement
on this point if it were possible to foresee
that such a situation would not last too
long, but would soon disappear in the presence
of durable and well-defined juridical relations.
But this cannot be foreseen by anybody if
the Lettish question is made dependent on
the Russian people. Who would venture to
affirm that the Russian people will soon be in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
a position to manifest freely its will and share
in the settlement of these questions?</p>

<p>Admiral Koltchak, for instance, has obtained,
on certain conditions accepted by him,
the promise of support from the Allied and
Associated Powers, and he is backed up by the
Russian Political Conference. But he is as yet
only in Siberia; much time will elapse before
he reaches the Volga, and from there Moscow
is yet far; but after all Moscow is not the whole
of Russia. Meanwhile, in the South, the Bolsheviki
have decided, it appears, to give final
battle to Admiral Koltchak. Even supposing
that Admiral Koltchak wins the most brilliant
of victories, much time will pass before tranquillity
returns to the country, before he
succeeds in re-establishing the administrative
machinery, and a Constituent Assembly is
elected in which the “Russian people will
be in a position to make its will known
freely.”</p>

<p>Even leaving these arguments aside, can
one be sure that the government of Admiral
Koltchak and the Constituent Assembly convened
by him will be recognised as authoritative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
and as the expression of the free will of
the Russian people? It is evident that in no
case will this happen without the hottest
opposition. Kerensky and his above-named
colleagues, the Paris Section of the Union
for Russian Regeneration, and the Russian
Republican League in their declaration
(<i>Humanit&eacute;</i>, 21st May, 1919) say, evidently
aiming at the party of Koltchak, “It is necessary
that the governments of the free peoples
declare openly that they will never recognise,
in Russia, any government whatsoever which
is a dictatorship of one man or of a group and
does not acknowledge the principle of popular
sovereignty nor take the essential measures for
its realisation.” In another direction, the
Russian National and Democratic Union
(<i>Bloc</i>), comprising the various leagues set up
for the regeneration of Russia, protests violently
against the conditions imposed by the
Allied and Associated Powers on Admiral
Koltchak and accepted by him (<i>Patrie</i>, 15th
June, 1919). So the future opposition to the
future Russian government is already there,
and even makes an appeal for support to all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
the free peoples. But who can say definitely
that with this support either Kerensky or
Koltchak will be in a position to get the upper
hand?</p>

<p>And again, should the government of
Lvov-Kerensky, or simply that of the latter
alone, be recognised as enjoying legal
continuity?</p>

<p>It is doubtful that the Russian Political
Conference and Admiral Koltchak are agreed.
M. A. N. Briantchaninoff, the Chairman of the
Slav Congress in Moscow and of the Russian
National Committee in London, talks openly
of the unheard-of inability of the Lvov-Kerensky
and Co. government (<i>Daily Telegraph</i>,
24th May, 1919). And the All-Russian
Constituent Assembly of the 5th January,
1918, under the famous presidency of M. V.
Tchernoff, which included Messrs. Lenin and
Trotsky? But M. Gregory Schreider proves
that the members of the Constituent Assembly
of 5th January, 1918, were shot by order of
Admiral Koltchak (<i>Daily Telegraph</i>, 28th
May, 1919). Koltchak would perhaps like to
continue in the same way. In any case, before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
taking up the case of Latvia, the Constituent
Assembly would have to decide the question
of summoning Admiral Koltchak to judgment;
and that might take up much time, considering
the complexity of the question and the
bias of the representatives of the Russian
people, entailing debates of indefinite length.
Consequently, whoever the candidate may be
whose power will be recognised as expressing
the free will of the Russian people, one may be
quite confident that a violent struggle will
ensue against him. For, to talk of free expression
of the will of the people, either with
or without the assistance of a foreign commission,
in a country devastated by war and
corrupted by Bolshevism, is naturally inadmissible
until the most elementary order is
established and the billows of political passion
have subsided. And thus years will pass by,
during which the question of the countries
detached from Russia will remain without
solution.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<h2 id="Right_of_the_Russian_People_to_participate"><span class="smcap">Right of the Russian People to participate
in the Solution of the Lettish
Question</span></h2>

<p>Outside the purely practical reasons, there
is a matter of principle; and looking more
closely at the proposal of the Russian Political
Conference, one cannot but be amazed by it.
By what right do they claim that the question
of the Lettish people “cannot be solved without
Russian knowledge and consent”? Who
made the Lettish people Slaves of the Russians?
Who made the Russians guardians of
the Letts? President Wilson has declared the
equality of nations and their equal right to
dispose of themselves. The second paragraph
of President Wilson’s message of the 22nd
January, 1917, says: “The equality of nations
on which peace must be founded in order
to be durable, must imply the equality of
rights; the exchanged guarantees must neither
recognise nor imply a difference between
the big nations and the small, between those
that are powerful and those that are weak.”
In the speech delivered on the 27th September,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
1918, Wilson declares: “The impartial
justice we want should not make any difference
between those in regard to whom we
are willing to be just and those in regard to
whom we are not willing to be just. It should
be a justice not knowing any favouritism, but
only the equal rights of the different peoples.”
Then, after such clear declarations on the part
of President Wilson, can one who declares
himself in agreement with this theory and
expresses (like the note of the Russian Political
Conference) his sympathy with the peoples
detached from Russia, can he require the
other nations to wait and not proceed with the
restoration of their affairs until the Russian
people has had the leisure to manifest its
opinion? And, after the Lettish people have
got rid of Bolshevism at the price of inconceivable
efforts and have, with the assistance
of the Allies, liberated Latvia from the German
armies of occupation, and when they have
finally succeeded in restoring their economic
and intellectual life, by what right would the
Russians, recovering themselves and facing a
problematical future, arrogate to themselves
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
the authority to possess and rule a people for
the regeneration of which they have not moved
a finger? Granted the right of the nations to
dispose of themselves, how could the Russian
Constituent Assembly or the government of
Admiral Koltchak be competent to decide the
fate of the Lettish people and yet the Lettish
Constituent Assembly or the Peace Conference
be incompetent&mdash;the latter having already
decided the destiny of many races?</p>

<p>To all these painful questions there is only
one possible answer: Would not the Russian
Political Conference admit that at the bottom
of its proposition there shows itself all too
clearly a point of view habitual to the old
Tzarist r&eacute;gime, according to which the borderland
peoples have no other right than to be
the object of the dominant nation’s rights?
But with such opinions, borrowed from the
old Tzarist r&eacute;gime’s domestic habits or home-policy,
it would simply not be safe to appear
before the Peace Conference, which has proclaimed
a just and happy future for all peoples,
inaugurating a new era of international justice.
Undoubtedly, the Russian Political Conference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
is cruelly deceived, both in regarding
their proposition as “a practical way out of
the present situation,” and even in thinking
they have given “a real proof of the new
spirit of Russia.” In point of fact, there is
neither a new spirit nor a practical solution of
the question.</p>

<h2 id="A_Definite_and_Immediate_Solution_of"><span class="smcap">A Definite and Immediate Solution of
the Question of Latvia is necessary</span></h2>

<p>The question of the formation of a State for
the Lettish people must be settled definitely
and as soon as possible. The Lettish people
can claim it as a right, for it finds itself in the
first rank of the peoples who have suffered
from the war. The interests of the other
nations also require it, for they will feel the
greater security the fewer undecided questions
there are, the fewer centres of trouble and
disorder.</p>

<p>The definite solution can be arrived at in
two ways: either by the reconstitution of
Russia in her former boundaries, excluding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
perhaps Poland, which would find its ethnographic
frontiers again, and that is the proposal
of the Russian Political Conference, of
M. A. Mandelstam, and other people and institutions
pretending to represent the Russian
people; or by the absolute recognition of the
independence of the peoples which have
separated themselves from Russia, and that
is what their representatives are working for.</p>

<h2 id="The_Reconstitution_of_Russia"><span class="smcap">The Reconstitution of Russia</span></h2>

<p>However, M. A. Mandelstam, the literary
idealist of the Russian Political Conference,
declares, in his <i>Memorandum on the Delimitation
of the Rights of States and Nations</i>
(Paris, 1919), that the interests of the countries
detached from Russia, their right to free
development of their economic and intellectual
culture, will be guaranteed and can only
be guaranteed by their reunion with Russia.
This reunion, he adds, is necessary not only in
the interests of Russia, but also in the interests
of these same countries.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<h2 id="Project_of_an_All-Russian_Federation"><span class="smcap">Project of an All-Russian Federation</span></h2>

<p>It is certain that they do not propose the
reconstitution of the old Tzarist r&eacute;gime, which,
according to M. A. Mandelstam, is no less
detested by the Russian people than by those
of the border countries; their aim is rather to
form a new Russia built on a quite different
foundation and distinguished by a perfect
justice towards all the peoples inhabiting her
territory. “Russia, emerging from the Revolution,”
says the Russian Political Conference,
“and definitely divorced from the centralising
tendencies of the old r&eacute;gime, is largely disposed
to satisfy the legitimate wish of these
nationalities to organise their national life.
The new Russia does not conceive her reconstitution
otherwise than in a free co-existence
of the peoples forming part of her, on the principles
of autonomy and federalism.” And M.
A. Mandelstam, forgetting that it is very difficult
for him, not being of Russian origin himself,
to speak and make promises in the name
of the Russian people, asserts: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>“The Russian

people has never been in agreement with the
old Russian policy in regard to the borderland
peoples, and has always suffered with them
from the same absence of political rights. It
will only wish to be allowed to work side by
side with its non-Russian brethren, mindful
of their rights as it will be of its own.... The
common life could be organised on the basis of
autonomy or on that of the federative principle,
or else on that of union. In any case, the
borderland peoples would no longer need to
fear any attacks on their personality on the
part of New Russia.”</p>

<h2 id="Point_of_View_of_the_Russian_Groups_in"><span class="smcap">Point of View of the Russian Groups in
regard to the Federation of Russia</span></h2>

<p>No doubt, there are many good intentions
and nice promises abroad; but nevertheless
we will allow ourselves slightly to doubt their
perfect sincerity, be it only in regard to some
of the representatives of the Russian groups.</p>

<p>How, for instance, do they reconcile this
crop of promises with the following facts?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
When, at the beginning of the year 1917, <i>i.e.</i>,
even before the Revolution, the Lettish
deputies in the Imperial Douma raised the
question of self-government for Latvia, M.
Miliukoff, then the all-powerful genius of the
Progressive Coalition (<i>Bloc</i>), expressed a hostile
opinion on this question, and underlined
it with the following words: “Then it will be
necessary to grant autonomy even to the
Samoyedes!” When, the same year, but
already after the Revolution, under the r&eacute;gime
of Kerensky, the law concerning self-government
for the Baltic provinces was in elaboration,
and the Lettish deputies pointed out the
absolute necessity of fusion, compact and with
well-defined boundaries, of all the territories
inhabited by the Letts, in a unity of self-government
without which the development
of the Lettish civilisation would become
difficult, the Russian Government replied
with a refusal, based on the inconvenience of
altering the existing departmental boundaries.
More recently, in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> of May
6th, 1919, M. C. Nabokoff, emphasising his
status as a Russian diplomatic representative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
in London, puts the Letts and Esthonians in
the same rank as the negroes of Texas. Their
leaning towards autonomy is described by him
as a “self-determination in a nursery,” and he
regards the Letts and Esthonians as “victims
of Teutonic propaganda,” to which he, M. C.
Nabokoff, will never and in no circumstances
submit. Consequently, as regards the promises
of the Russian Political Conference and the
assurances of M. Mandelstam, we have testimonies
of the representatives of the different
Russian political groups at different periods
in their different situations, before the Revolution,
after the Revolution, and after the
second Revolution; testimonies, thoughtless
perhaps, and ill-calculated, but so much the
more sincere.</p>

<p>However, the “Russian diplomatic representative
in London,” who, from the service
of the Tzarist government, has gone over,
without much effort, to that of the government
represented by M. Mandelstam&mdash;after
having acquired a fuller knowledge of Texas,
and even without this, will be quite willing to
change his views about the Letts and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Esthonians in accordance with the views and
intentions of his new chiefs. No doubt M.
Miliukoff, who has been able to master his
antipathy to Germany, will, for reasons of
necessity, vanquish also his aversion for the
self-government of Latvia. But how can the
Lettish people, or the Peace Conference as it
decides the fate of nations, be assured that in
the future and under new conditions, Messrs.
Nabokoff and Miliukoff will not reconvert M.
Mandelstam, Admiral Koltchak, etc., along
with themselves and the Russian Political
Conference? Can one expect the Lettish
people or the Peace Conference to have faith
in their word when the Russian groups
themselves have not full confidence in one
another?</p>

<p>Kerensky and his colleagues do not believe
a bit in the promises of Admiral Koltchak
in regard to the convening of the Constituent
Assembly on a democratic basis. M.
A. N. Briantchaninoff categorically rejects
M. Kerensky. M. Miliukoff, as it appears,
professes no confidence in the Constituent
Assembly presided over by V. Tchernoff, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Admiral Koltchak even shoots its members,
which crime M. Schreider will never forgive
him. If there exists such a complete mistrust
among the Russian groups in regard to one
another, if people who know the valuable
qualities of their fellow-countrymen release
floods of accusations on one another, what
faith is it possible to have, I will not say in
the sincerity of their promises, but in the
possibility of fulfilling them?</p>

<h2 id="Impossibility_of_a_Russian_Federation"><span class="smcap">Impossibility of a Russian Federation</span></h2>

<p>Besides personal confidence or mistrust,
there are also much deeper reasons of an
objective kind which clearly show that the
promises of the Russian groups are, in spite
of their good will, absolutely unrealisable.
One would need to be imbued with an absolute
Bolshevist disregard for the laws of
historical continuity to admit that Russia, by
the mere force of a decree and solely by the
good will of honest people, will straightway
pass from being a country subject to Tzarist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
despotism and unaccustomed to the respect
of rights, of personality, and of nationalities,
to a r&eacute;gime of equality of rights and justice
for all. There are no big jumps in History;
and if they are attempted, they are paid for
grievously. The proof of this is afforded by
the happenings in Russia, which, it was
boasted, had passed without bloodshed from
the autocratic r&eacute;gime of the Tzar to the
“freest r&eacute;gime in the world”&mdash;the Lvov-Kerensky
r&eacute;gime; but streams of blood and
unheard-of cruelties have followed. Russia
has fallen to ruins under the despotic r&eacute;gime
of Lenin and Trotsky.</p>

<h2 id="Historical_Impossibility_of_an_All-Russian"><span class="smcap">Historical Impossibility of an All-Russian
Federation</span></h2>

<p>The history of centuries, customs and habits,
rooted usages and popular psychology are
much more effectual than the best intentions
and decrees, which in the most favourable
circumstances can only bring about an external
change. But under the mask of the latter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
the Past continues to exist. We have already
shown that in the proposal itself of the Russian
Political Conference, under a new phraseology,
there is concealed at the bottom the
psychology of the Tzarist bureaucracy, of
which the Russian Political Conference has
not succeeded in freeing itself. If the old
psychology is so sturdy in the minds of the
best sons of Russia, who are accustomed to
direct themselves according to the best
theoretical conceptions, and who have been
brought up in the atmosphere of European
ideas, what then can be expected from the
over-excited instincts of ignorant masses
reared in utter contempt of another’s personality
and rights?</p>

<p>It is certain that the rebirth of Russia will
coincide with an extraordinary upheaval of
the nationalist wave, a quite natural upheaval
after the humiliation of national dignity
suffered by Russia, an upheaval of which all
that is foreign and non-Russian will be the
inevitable victim. This wave will clear the
ground for Messrs. Mandelstam, Sazonoff,
Kerensky, Schreider, etc. M. C. Nabokoff will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
incontestably allow himself to be carried away
by that wave, and if Admiral Koltchak and
General Denikin do not, at least those that
will come after them, perhaps M. Briantchaninoff,
will benefit by it.</p>

<h2 id="A_Common_Civilisation_indispensable"><span class="smcap">A Common Civilisation, indispensable
to a Federation, does not exist</span></h2>

<p>What will be the effect of this Chauvinist
wave on the All-Russian Federation planned
by the Russian groups, and composed of a
series of national States? In accordance with
the laws of reaction, the Russian nationalist
upheaval will call forth a similar movement
in the other nationalities of the Russian
Federation. Besides, these peoples are even
now in different stages of civilisation. They
are being besought from various directions,
and the exasperation of the national feeling in
each of them will set up another and a still
more sensitive difference. There will not be
that spiritual community without which a
free co-existence is inconceivable. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
spiritual community did not exist under the
Tzarist r&eacute;gime, which however tried to create
it by enforced russification, going even so far
as to prohibit the use of the mother-alphabet
and the public use of the mother-language,
and ordering that teaching in the elementary
schools should be given in Russian to children
who did not understand a word of it. By such
proceedings, a kind of spiritual community
among the peoples of Russia has indeed been
created; no one doubts it&mdash;there is unanimous
opposition against such means of furthering
Russian civilisation.</p>

<p>No harmony of civilisation could exist, even
in the projected All-Russian Federation.
Within its limits there would be nations
which, owing to favourable geographical situation
and greater activity, have long led the
intensive life of western civilisation; and there
would also be peoples which are as yet in the
first stage of civilisation.</p>

<p>For instance, what harmony is it possible
to imagine as existing between the Letts and
the Samoyedes of M. Miliukoff, or between
the Esthonians and the Fetishists of Siberia?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Russia is populated by nations unable to
understand one another, not only on account
of the difference of language, but also because
of the contrasting customs and habits, ideas,
religious creeds, and popular psychology. No
one of these nationalities possesses such a
strong preponderance in the matter of numbers
and civilisation, nor such powerful influence,
that the other peoples should submit to it of
their own free will.</p>

<p>M. Victoroff-Toporoff finds (<i>Pages Modernes</i>,
No. 1, April, 1919, p. 24) that there is something
which unites all the nationalities of
Russia&mdash;“the great intellectual force of the
people of Greater Russia,” which through the
medium of masterpieces of the famous Russian
teachers and writers, has spread broadcast
among all the peoples of Russia. It is
certain that no one will try to minimise the
importance of Russian literature, nor dispute
the place which is its due among the literatures
of the world. But Russian literature by itself
is not yet world-literature, and the literature
of other nations as well has exercised an enormous
influence on the peoples of Russia. For
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
instance, the influence of the French masters
on Lettish culture is far stronger than that of
Russian art. But apart from this, each nationality
detached from Russia has its national
literature, which we all admit does not perhaps
possess great masterpieces like Russian literature,
but has nevertheless its individual
character, and consequently stands nearer and
dearer to its people and is capable of greater
influence on it than all the masterpieces of
foreign art.</p>

<p>The All-Russian Federation has no common
basis for its diverse members in the field of
civilisation. Consequently, there are two
courses open to it:&mdash;either to give to each
people the liberty of development, in which
case the nationalities would very soon disperse
intellectually in all directions; or to
revive the russifying centralist tendencies, the
likelihood of which is made evident by the
expected rising of Russian chauvinism. In
both cases there remains nothing of the
Federation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<h2 id="The_Economic_Problem_of_a_Federated"><span class="smcap">The Economic Problem of a Federated
Russia</span></h2>

<p>If between the peoples of Russia there are
no interests in common as regards intellectual
culture, there is still less in common in the
economic relationships of the different parts of
Russia.</p>

<p>It is well known that Russia, since the
ministries of Vishnegradsky and Witte, leaned
more and more consciously towards the protectionist
system; and having created the
autonomous Customs tariff of 1893, leaned
towards the creation Of a self-supporting
economic unit. This policy was based on balancing
the agricultural interests on the one
side and the industrial interests on the other.
Industry was protected at the expense of
agriculture, but without exceeding the limits
which allowed the world’s markets to be preserved
for Russian agricultural products, for
otherwise this would have led to the destruction
of Russia’s commercial equilibrium. This
was a quite reasonable policy, and indispensable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
from the point of view of a one and
indivisible Russia with an economic system
completely centralised. And this policy, supposing
its necessity, must be reverted to in a
reunited Russia.</p>

<p>But it is also quite clear that to the interests
of this policy, indispensable to a self-sufficient
economic unit, important interests of the
different parts of Russia have been sacrificed.
For instance, the corn-growing central provinces
of Russia have lost the English market,
with difficulty retaining the much less profitable
market in Germany.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Latvia, in no way
interested in the export of cereals, was
obliged, in order to assist the Russian grain
export, and in virtue of the commercial treaties
concluded between Russia and Germany in
1894 and 1904, to submit to concessions in
regard to German industry which were incompatible
with her own industrial interests.</p>

<p>By the case of Finland, it is possible to form
an idea of the results of such an economic
system. From the importation of Russian
corn, Finland passed to the importation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
German and American flour; instead of
Russian sugar she used German. In return
the products of Russian industry have not
been able to conquer the Finnish market, in
view of the impossibility of their competition
with German products. Finland, having
Customs frontiers with Russia, was able to
avoid the too disadvantageous consequences
for her of that Russian economic policy which
sacrificed local economic interests to a centralised
economic system for Russia. If there
had not been Customs frontiers between
Finland and Russia, Finland would have had
to pay much dearer for her bread and to purchase
industrial products at a much higher
price. The other parts of Russia, not enjoying
economic autonomy, have not been able to
avoid the disastrous consequences of the
Russian policy as Finland has done.</p>

<p>Consequently, the founders of Federated
Russia will have to solve the following question:
Must we revert to a centralised policy
and neglect the local interests of the different
parts of Russia, or must we grant the right of
an autonomous economic policy to the different
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
members of the Federation? In the former
case, there would remain very little of the
“free co-existence of the peoples forming
part of it on principles of autonomy and
federation.” From this point of view the
nationalities would be less favoured than Finland,
which, as is well known, was far from
feeling outside the danger of Russian pretensions.
If, on the contrary, the founders of the
Federated Republic of Russia propose to give
to the various States the right of an autonomous
economic policy, then the Federation
will very soon fall to pieces, for the economic
interests of the different States tend in different
directions, and economic interests are
much more powerful than historical memories.</p>

<p>The economic problem will therefore be
solved either to the advantage of a Russia
which supports herself, but is at the same
time centralised, or to the advantage of the
independence of the nationalities which have
separated themselves from Russia. In either
case there is no place for federation!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<h2 id="The_All-Russian_Federation_from_the"><span class="smcap">The All-Russian Federation from the
Point of View of Constitutional Law</span></h2>

<p>There still remains to be elucidated the
project of an All-Russian Federation from
the point of view of constitutional law, <i>i.e.</i>,
the possibility of creating, with the aid of the
nationalities of Russia, a durable State on the
basis of federation.</p>

<p>The definite and authorised answer to this
question was given by the late M. Kokoshkin,
professor at the University of Moscow, in his
report (Summer, 1917) to the Congress of the
Constitutional Democratic Party on the subject
of the desirable form for the future State of
Russia. He proved the utter impossibility,
from the point of view of constitutional law,
of reconstructing Russia on a federative basis;
and the Congress of the Party entirely
subscribed to his opinion. There remains
little to say after the view of Professor
Kokoshkin.</p>

<p>All federations of States can work on one
condition only, viz., that there is one among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
them which has the power, owing to its importance
and influence, to support and unite
all the other members. Germany gives us an
instance of this law. First, in 1866, Bismarck
was compelled to exclude Austria by force
from the German Confederation, on account
of her competition with Prussia, so that he
could, in 1871, gather round him the German
Federation, in which Prussia, both by her
real force and in accordance with constitutional
law, became the predominant partner. And
the Prussian spirit guided Germany. Prussia
was the cause of Germany’s extraordinary
development, and also of her unprecedented
defeat. The contrary is instanced by Austria-Hungary,
which tottered in proportion as
German Austria increasingly lost her preponderance.</p>

<p>Can one reckon on finding, among the
nationalities of Russia, a member of the
projected Federation with enough authority,
from the point of view of constitutional law,
to unite and support the other members of
the Federation? To this question Professor
Kokoshkin has given a negative and categorical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
reply, and we must abide by this
opinion.</p>

<p>Evidently, the section of the Great-Russians
could, in the first place, lay claim to such a
part. But they count only 65 millions out of
the 180 millions forming the population of
Russia. Besides, this section is far from having
preponderant economic importance, and it
has remained, in the matter of civilisation,
well behind the other members of the projected
All-Russian Federation. If the leading part is
given to this section&mdash;a majority of votes in
the Council of the Federation, for instance&mdash;it
would be a great injustice to the other nationalities,
and they would never consent to it;
an otherwise senseless injustice, because the
section of the Great-Russians will evidently
never be in a position to perform the part
assigned to them, nor could they perform it
except by using physical force, <i>i.e.</i>, by re-establishing
the policy of centralist absolutism,
the policy which has sustained so complete a
defeat, and that not only by a mere historical
chance.</p>

<p>If there is no directing centre, it is clear that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
the All-Russian Federation will fall to pieces
on the morrow of its foundation on paper, for
there will be no power in a position to reconcile
the divergent interests of the various
members of the Federation. Georgia, for
instance, will never consent to vote credits for
the development of Northern railway systems.
Latvia will give no contribution for the construction
of Black Sea ports; and Ukraine
will not send her sons to defend the Baltic
Sea. The combination of these interests, so
different and so scattered, would only result
in a State-structure so weak that it would
fall to pieces at the first serious blow.</p>

<p>Thus, from the point of view of constitutional
law, we arrive at the same conclusion
to which the analysis of the tendencies of
civilisation and economic life led us&mdash;that
the All-Russian Federation will transform
itself either into a centralised State maintained
by force, or it will divide itself into
independent States.</p>

<p>There is no place for a Federation in Russia!
Neither the land nor the men upon it were
made for it; this is proved by History. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
history of Russia in her beginnings shows us
a certain number of principalities, independent
of one another, and on the whole not
subject to any authority. Owing to the efforts
of the more powerful princes, and under the
duress of the Tartar yoke, the principalities
united, not into a Federation, but into a
centralised State; and each principality,
deprived of its independence, did not become
a member of a Federation, but passed into
another State.</p>

<p>The same course was followed in regard to
the contiguous and neighbouring countries
conquered by Russia.</p>

<p>Not only Finland and Poland, but also the
Baltic, Ukraine, and Georgia were united to
Russia, and received from her at least the
guarantee of their special rights and of their
separate position in the Russian State; but
Russia did not keep her word in regard to all
these States, but had them all subject to a
centralised policy, after having destroyed, or
attempted to destroy, all the individuality of
these countries. And this is in no way by mere
chance. The Russian plain, having almost no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
natural divisions, is not a favourable field for
the creation of a Federation, and the Russian
soul, understanding no <i>via media</i> between
“all” and “nothing,” is not the cement with
which it would be possible to build a Federation
always based on the limitation of one will
by other wills, and on a clever and experienced
blend of the different inclinations.</p>

<h2 id="The_Leaning_of_the_Peoples_of_Russia"><span class="smcap">The Leaning of the Peoples of Russia
towards Independence</span></h2>

<p>Not being able to put their trust in the All-Russian
Federation and not finding therein
enough guarantee for their natural rights, the
peoples of Russia have separated themselves
from her and are building up their independent
national life. This is what is rousing the
opposition of the representatives of the Russian
groups. The grounds for it are given by
M. Mandelstam in several pamphlets published
by the Russian Political Conference.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<h2 id="Economic_Disadvantage_of_Separation"><span class="smcap">Economic Disadvantage of Separation
from Russia</span></h2>

<p>First of all, M. Mandelstam finds that the
independence to which the nationalities detached
from Russia are aspiring is disadvantageous
to these peoples themselves: “So
they would merely find in their independence
a satisfaction of their national vanity, too
heavily paid for by the loss of their economic
prosperity.” (<i>Memorandum on the Delimitation
of the Rights of States and Nations</i>, p. 79.)
Concerning Latvia in particular, M. Mandelstam
foresees that the commerce of her ports
will enormously suffer, for they will lose the
benefit of the Russian transit trade. Agriculture,
which will lose the Russian market, will
equally suffer from it; her industry will be
deprived of fuel and raw materials (p. 60).
Finally, Latvia will not be in a position to
guarantee “the reimbursement of the enormous
amounts spent for the development of
her economic prosperity and for her defence”
(p. 79).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<h2 id="Settlement_of_Accounts_between"><span class="smcap">Settlement of Accounts between
Latvia and Russia</span></h2>

<p>Let us take the last point first, viz., the
mutual settlement of accounts between Latvia
and Russia.</p>

<p>It seems that here M. Mandelstam wishes
either to frighten us or simply to “overcharge”
us.</p>

<p>Now from the statements of the Ministry of
Finance it is evident that Latvia has given
yearly to the State a surplus of revenue over
and above the expenditure, which is valued at
about 30 million roubles, after having paid
out of her own revenues all the expenses of the
State within the boundaries of Latvia, including
expenditure on numerous institutions,
on strong armies and frontier guards, etc.
In how many yearly instalments does M.
Mandelstam intend to repay that surplus to
Latvia?</p>

<p>It is absolutely impossible to understand of
what expenses for the defence of Latvia M.
Mandelstam is speaking. Latvia’s share in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
the State Budget, including army and navy, as
we have already seen, is paid off with a surplus
for the Russian Budget. Of what other expenditure
then is M. Mandelstam speaking?
Of war expenses for a defence which was a
failure and brought Latvia nothing but destruction
and ruins? Who would pay for a
task so badly done? And if that is the expense
referred to, what is the cost M. Mandelstam
puts on the senseless and aimless devastation
carried out in Latvia by Russian armies?
They are very well depicted in the exhaustive
work by M. J. Sahlit, member of the Imperial
Douma.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Another indiscreet question: At what rate
of exchange does M. Mandelstam suggest
paying the mass of Russian credit-notes
with which Latvia was deluged, and against
which the Russian Government has received
goods of a fixed weight and at a fixed
price?</p>

<p>If a reckoning is set up&mdash;for conscience’
sake, naturally&mdash;Latvia will have to receive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
from Russia amounts which will be a considerable
balance in the establishment of her
own finances.</p>

<h2 id="Economic_Interests_of_Latvia"><span class="smcap">Economic Interests of Latvia</span></h2>

<p>Concerning the economic interests of Latvia,
it is scarcely probable that M. Mandelstam
need defend them against the Letts themselves.
This time M. Mandelstam has evidently gone
to unnecessary trouble. If the economic
interests of Latvia so weightily necessitate
her reunion with Russia, the Letts, being
accustomed to calculate quite dispassionately,
will soon see their advantage and will be
anxious to adhere to the All-Russian Federation
projected by M. Mandelstam of their
own free will. Consequently, why does M.
Mandelstam insist on establishing Latvia’s
happiness by force and compulsion? Is it
possible he has forgotten that he who tries
to prove too much proves nothing?</p>

<p>Besides, M. Mandelstam appears to be ill-informed
on the economic life of Latvia. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
is not true that Latvia needs the Russian
market for her agricultural products. It will
not be difficult for her to find a more profitable
market in the West. It is equally not true
that Latvia will be deprived of the transit
trade of Russia, for her ports are the most
convenient transit points for Russia; and
Latvia, for the purpose of increasing and
developing this transit trade, will do her best
to further her own interests. M. Mandelstam
is equally mistaken as regards Lettish industry.
Fuel, in the shape of coal, has been
supplied to her up to the present not by Russia,
but principally by England, and Russian
iron ore could easily be replaced by Swedish.
Generally speaking, one may say that Latvia,
being in a better economic situation than
Russia, can rightly hope that the latter will
look for normal economic relations with
Latvia, and it would have been more comprehensive
and more natural if M. Mandelstam
had only taken up the defence of Russia’s
economic interests.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<h2 id="Aspirations_of_the_Letts"><span class="smcap">Aspirations of the Letts</span></h2>

<p>M. Mandelstam may unhesitatingly leave
the defence of Lettish interests to the Letts
themselves. They have studied them and
understand them well. Lettish aspirations
were born neither to-day nor yesterday. The
birth of the Lettish movement took place in
1860. Since that time it has been under the
double oppression of the Baltic barons and
the Russian bureaucracy. But it has courageously
borne this double yoke, and has
proved its vitality and activity. It has thrived
and developed; it has taken deep root in the
soul of the people whence it cannot be eradicated
again. It is certain that the Lettish
people possesses what President Wilson calls
“well-defined national aspirations.” These
have clearly appeared in the sharp and closely-followed
line maintained by the Lettish
people during the whole war in perfect unanimity.
The Letts have fought with all their
might against Germany to defend their aspirations
against Teutonic tendencies. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
National Council of Latvia, in the fatal period
of the Russian flight and the German occupation
of a considerable portion of Latvia,
was able to centre in itself the whole social
activity and political thought of the Lettish
people. In its first session, from 16th to 19th
November, 1917, it asked for the Lettish
nation the right to dispose of themselves. In
the second, from 15th to 19th January, 1918,
it very categorically stated that “Latvia
asks to be recognised as a sovereign, independent
and indivisible State.” The National
Council informed Russia of its decision in the
speech of its representative, J. Goldman, in
the Constituent Assembly of Russia, on the
5th January, 1918. The National Council, in
spite of the personal danger to its members,
in a protest note addressed on the 4th April,
1918, to the German Chancellor, Count Hertling,
explicitly opposed the German inclination
to unite Latvia to Germany. Already in
July, 1918, the National Council had addressed
itself to the Allied Governments and the
opinion of the whole world, protesting against
the peace of Brest-Litovsk and revealing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
clumsy deceit of the German occupation
authority in proclaiming as the will of the
Lettish people the decisions of the Landesrath,
a usurping body composed of German barons
and their servants; and the National Council
emphasised the unbending decision of the
Lettish people to attain the realisation of
its natural rights to independence. The
National Council of Latvia considered it a
great honour that its aspirations were crowned
with success. It was recognised as an independent
body by the Governments of England
and Japan.</p>

<p>Having suffered long at the hands of both
Russia and Germany, the Lettish people has
come to the conclusion that it would find its
interests guaranteed only by independence.
It is not a passing mood, but a firm conviction,
for which the Lettish people has suffered and
which it will never and in no case surrender.
And it awaits the realisation of its aspirations
and the solemn proclamation of its rights.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<h2 id="Protests_of_the_Russian_Groups"><span class="smcap">Protests of the Russian Groups</span></h2>

<p>However, the Russian groups protest in
the name of the interests of the Russian people,
who, they say, will oppose the separation of
an independent Latvia. One might briefly
reply that the one-sided interests of the
Russian people would not solve this question,
and that an exclusive solution in favour of
the interests of the Russian people would be
in opposition to the principle of international
relations proclaimed by the Allies. In his
speech delivered on the 4th July, 1918,
President Wilson declared: “The settlement
of any one of the questions concerning
either territories, national sovereignty, economic
or political relations, must be made on
the basis of the free acceptation of such a
settlement by the peoples directly concerned,
and not on the basis of material interest or
advantage of any other nation or people.”
And in the message of September 27th, 1918,
President Wilson said: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>“No individual or
special interest of a nation or a group of
nations shall be able so to inspire a part of the

arrangement that it would not be in agreement
with the united interests of all.”</p>

<p>It would seem that these declarations leave
nothing to be desired from the point of view
of clearness and conciseness, and they were
pronounced in the most solemn manner and
adopted both by the Allies and their adversaries
as a basis on which future international
relations might be established. It would seem
also that these declarations do not leave any
doubt about the fact that the question of
Latvia and her fate should be solved on the
basis of the aspirations and wishes of the
Lettish people, and not in accordance with the
interests of Russia. However, to complete
the picture, we might as well discuss the
question of those Russian interests which, we
are told, would suffer by the separation of
Latvia.</p>

<h2 id="Economic_Interests_of_Russia"><span class="smcap">Economic Interests of Russia</span></h2>

<p>The Russian groups and their ideologists
put forward the economic interests of Russia,
which, they say, do not in any way permit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the separation of Latvia. “Russian foreign
trade,” says Mandelstam (<i>Memorandum on
the Delimitation of the Rights of States and
Nations</i>), “was principally sea-borne; from
this point of view the Baltic ports were of the
highest importance to it” (p. 58). “The
complete separation of the Baltic provinces
from Russia would put this latter in an extremely
difficult and grave situation, by
depriving her of her outlets in the Baltic,
which are not only the most important but
also the only practicable ones in the winter”
(p. 60).</p>

<p>The fact in itself is certainly correct. Before
the war almost half of the imports and more
than two-fifths of the exports of European
Russia by sea passed through the great ports
of Latvia: Riga, Libau, Windau. But who
would suppose that Latvia will close her
ports to the transit trade of Russia? On the
contrary, Latvia understands quite well that
she is the natural intermediary between East
and West, and will, in her own interests, do
her best by every means to encourage trade
with Russia. The natural destiny of Latvia is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
to be a storehouse for goods coming from the
West to Russia and <i>vice versa</i>. And everything
makes us believe that Latvia will be in
a position to perform that r&ocirc;le better than
Russia herself.</p>

<p>The chief conditions required by commerce
are the following: Suitable technical establishments,
simple and precise juridical relations,
and lastly, order and tranquillity.
Russia has not been able to provide these
conditions. To be satisfied of this, one has but
to remember the wretched equipment of the
ports, so disproportionate to their world-importance,
the miserable state of the railways,
the lack of means of transport, the
abuses and disorder. Judicial relations were
regulated by laws dating almost from the
Flood, the same for the Russian villages as
for the towns of universal importance, laws
which would much better have suited the
former alone. The proceedings at the courts
of law were of fabulous duration; the code
of laws affecting commercial houses and companies
was out of date; conditions of credit
were of the worst; and, in consequence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
Germany, which enjoys the ability to accommodate
herself to all the Russian conditions,
increasingly invaded the economic life of the
Baltic Sea, dispersing the competition of
others. No, it was neither Russian firms nor
capital which prevailed there, but those of
Germany, and the watchword came not from
Petrograd but from Berlin. Russia would not
have succeeded as quickly as Latvia in freeing
herself from the preponderating influence
on the shores of the Baltic. That is why
Russia’s interests will in no way suffer if the
intermediary’s r&ocirc;le is played neither by her
nor Germany, but by those who are familiar
with the Baltic, whom nature has attached
to it, and who consequently have natural
rights to it.</p>

<h2 id="Strategical_Interests_of_Russia"><span class="smcap">Strategical Interests of Russia</span></h2>

<p>The Russian groups lay great stress on the
strategical interests of Russia. The separation
of Latvia, they say, would greatly prejudice
these. The frontiers of Russia, after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
Latvia’s separation, would strategically be so
disadvantageous that it would be difficult to
defend them successfully. The former frontiers,
with Latvia included, were on the contrary
very favourable. Yet Russia did not
and could not defend them. There is no doubt
that if, in 1914, the Germans had, instead of
throwing themselves on France, directed their
forces to the East, they would have occupied
without much difficulty the whole territory of
Latvia; and Russia would have been deprived
anyhow of the advantages of strategical
frontiers and bases for her fleet. This hypothesis
has been fully proved by the events that
followed. In the spring of 1915, the German
forces, relatively weak, easily succeeded in
seizing the South of Courland, with the very
important base for their navy at Libau, and
took up positions on the River Venta. An
attempt was then made to draw the attention
of the Commander-in-Chief, Grand Duke
Nicholas Nikolaievich, to the necessity of a
vigorous defence of Courland in view of her
military, political and economic importance.
It was then that the Grand Duke, not sharing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
the opinion of the Russian groups on the
strategical importance of Latvia, made his
famous retort, “I don’t give a damn for your
Courland!”&mdash;words which to-day still resound
in the ears of every Lett. And in the summer
of 1915, a few German detachments were seen
occupying, almost without any resistance on
the part of the Russians, the greater part of
Courland. It is easy to believe in the little
importance of the German forces and in
Courland’s weak defence when one learns that
mere patrols of cavalry took possession of
whole towns almost without firing a shot.
Seeing this, two sections of Lettish reservists
who had been ordered to retreat, begged to be
allowed to defend Mitau, and the permission
was granted to them. These heroic soldiers
offered to the Germans such a violent and
unexpected resistance that the latter hesitated
for a long time before coming nearer to the
town.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1915, the front was established
on the line of the River Daugava
(Dwina). The Russian Political Conference
will perhaps say that this is precisely the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
strategic line which they contemplate. If that
is so, it is fresh proof that in the hands of
Russia strategical advantages have no importance.
We know from the words publicly pronounced
by the commander of an army on
the Riga front, Radko-Dmitrieff, that Riga
would have fallen in the autumn of 1915 but
for the bravery of the Lettish troops, raised,
as it is known, by Lettish patriots, after
heated argument with the Russian bureaucracy.
In the main, it was not the Russians
so much as the Letts who defended the
Riga front. It is enough to recollect the long
siege which they sustained without respite on
the “island of death,” near Ixk&uuml;le, and the
famous breach made by them in the German
front near Mangoul, a breach which unfortunately
led to nothing, owing to the lack of
Russian troops to support them. Let us quote
the characteristic and significant words spoken
by the Kaiser after an inspection of the Riga
front: “Riga will fall into my hands like a
ripe fruit when eight stars have died out on
that front.” He meant by this the eight
detachments of the Lettish army.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>The 2nd September, 1917, the Germans
broke through the Riga front, and at least
two Russian divisions would have been made
prisoners if it had not been for the stubborn
resistance of certain Lettish regiments, which
were then annihilated. After this struggle they
existed only in name, a glorious name with
which the Bolsheviki continued to frighten
their Russian adversaries.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>By this we can see that favourable strategical
positions, in unskilful hands, become
rather a snare than an advantage. The fact
is that you cannot get immediate advantage
out of a favourable strategical line if you have
not the wish, the will, and the capacity to
profit by it. Russia lacked both the goodwill
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
and the capacity; they were absent in the
Commander-in-Chief as well as in that moujik
deserter from Riazan who replied to all
exhortations: “Why should I fight? I’m
not going to fish in that sea.”</p>

<p>The world-war has proved that patriotic
spirit in an army and an understanding of
duty are no less indispensable than the technique,
favourable positions, etc. Will Russia
be able to make her Grand Dukes and moujiks
believe that their feeling of duty must extend
to the strategic frontiers of the Baltic Sea, in
a foreign land? We doubt it. Therefore,
Russia’s defence will not be prejudiced if the
strategical points aimed towards the West
fall into stronger and surer hands than hers.</p>

<p>And the question of Russia’s defence must
be examined from another point of view.
Against whom is Russia preparing her defence
in the West? Against Latvia? It would be a
grave insult to Russia to pretend that Latvia,
with her two million and a half inhabitants,
could dream of an aggressive act against
Russia, which, counting only the Great-Russians,
possesses 65 million inhabitants.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
Against Esthonia then, with her million and
a half inhabitants? Against Lithuania, with
her six million inhabitants? To put these
questions is to answer them. Against Poland
or Ukraine? But in that case the strategical
positions of the Baltic Sea have nothing to do
with it. Against a coalition of all these States?
This is questionable, for strong and adequate
as a defensive coalition of all these States
might be regarded, an offensive coalition on
their part against Russia is obviously unlikely
and futile, for in the latter case there could be
neither community of interest nor a common
object in aggression.</p>

<p>There remains the hypothesis of M. Mandelstam
(<i>Memorandum on the Delimitation of the
Rights of States and Nations</i>, p. 57), that the
territory of Latvia may serve as a very favourable
point of disembarkation for armies
attacking Russia. If M. Mandelstam has
Germany in view as a potential adversary, one
can set him at ease by telling him that all the
interests of Latvia are directed against Germany,
and to suspect her of a future alliance
with Germany is simply inadmissible. In the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
case of an aggressive tendency on the part of
Germany, Latvia will have to defend herself,
and one can suppose that she will do it more
successfully than Russia, which could not
thus be other than much obliged to her,
in view of Latvia’s carrying out for her a task
which had proved beyond Russia’s power.</p>

<p>Russia’s defence will thus in no way be prejudiced
by the shores of the Baltic not being
guarded by herself but by a more watchful
sentry, of whom one could not expect any
aggressive tendency, but who would nevertheless
oppose himself, in the name of his own
interests, to any aggression coming either
from the West or East.</p>

<p>The Lettish people claims the realisation of
its natural right to an independent existence
and free development. Within the boundaries
of Russia this was and will be impossible.
Consequently, the Lettish people is right in
demanding its constitution as an independent
State, and this all the more because the interests
of the Russian people will not suffer
by it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<h2 id="Guarantees_of_the_World-Peace"><span class="smcap">Guarantees of the World-Peace</span></h2>

<p>It would be possible to end here if the
question was merely one of tracing a line of
delimitation between the interests of the
Russian people and those of the Lettish
people. But that is not so&mdash;one could not lose
sight of a more universal interest. What will
be the result of the limits traced between the
Lettish people and the Russian people, in the
matter of other nations’ interests? A new
international dawn will rise when the Paris
Conference has established guarantees for the
maintenance of peace. Everything must be
done to avoid the disasters of a future war.</p>

<p>And precisely from this point of view, voices
are heard proclaiming that in the interests of
political equilibrium, a strong Russia must be
rebuilt, as far as possible within her former
frontiers. They even say that if no Russia
existed, one must be invented.</p>

<h2 id="Principle_of_Political_Equilibrium"><span class="smcap">Principle of Political Equilibrium</span></h2>

<p>Certainly, it is possible to make a primary
reply to this opinion by saying that political
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
equilibrium is incriminated, and that in its
place will come the League of Nations guaranteeing
peace and justice for all. The reply
is valid. But we are also disposed to agree
with those who say that the League of Nations
will be formed only in the future and at present
it is incapable of fulfilling all the tasks which
we await from it. For this reason, if only as a
subsidiary factor, one must not lose sight of
the problems of political equilibrium.</p>

<h2 id="Russia_as_a_Factor_in_Political"><span class="smcap">Russia as a Factor in Political
Equilibrium</span></h2>

<p>This equilibrium does not establish the
necessity of re-creating Russia as she was
before the war, for Russia was in no way a
factor powerful enough to support that equilibrium.
Knowing Russia’s internal weakness,
Germany had no fear in launching the world-war.
And during the war Russia’s forces
proved insufficient to weigh down the scales
of victory on the Allies’ side. On the contrary,
during all the time the hostilities lasted,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
Russia was strategically, as well as politically
and economically, the weakest point of the
Allies. Finally she left them to the grace of
God after having made them a present of the
pest of Bolshevism. It is clear that, even in
the case of reconstruction in her former
boundaries, Russia will not for a long time be
in a position to perform the part of an ally
and help to maintain the European equilibrium.
Russia is ruined; ruined not only by
the war, but also, and much more, by Bolshevism;
ruined physically, economically and
much more morally and intellectually. More
than a generation will be required before
Russia can count as a factor in European
policy. And who will maintain the equilibrium
in the meantime?</p>

<h2 id="Internal_Weakness_of_Russia"><span class="smcap">Internal Weakness of Russia</span></h2>

<p>But even after a long rest and complete
external reconstruction, Russia, in the case
of serious aggression, will always prove internally
to be a considerably weaker factor than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
it would be possible to judge of from the outside.
That was the case during the Japanese
war in 1904-5. And so she was also during
the war which has just ended. Russia’s external
strength has always been imaginary, for
she has always been weak internally. And
this is not an accidental, momentary or passing
weakness, but a weakness dependent on
Russia’s composition and her home-policy.
We have already shown that Russia is composed
of a series of regions which by their
population, history, culture and economic
interests are not bound together, but tend
in different directions, and are merely held
together by perpetual compulsion. By reason
of this there will always be a centralised home-policy
in Russia, and, consequently, a lot of
unsolved and insoluble problems therein; a
policy the principal means of which will always
be force and compulsion. And as soon
as compulsion relaxes, the problems and
anomalies artificially kept under come again
to the surface and paralyse all the forces of
Russia. The history of Russia shows that
precisely on account of her internal weakness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
and under the threat of revolution, she has
been unable to end with success any one of
the last wars.</p>

<h2 id="Political_Leanings_of_Russia_towards"><span class="smcap">Political Leanings of Russia towards
Germany</span></h2>

<p>But besides that, as concerns Russia, it will
never be possible to tell in which direction she
will turn. At the beginning of the last century,
allied to Prussia and Austria, she fought
against France, and became the inspirer of the
Holy Alliance which was directed, in full
accord with the character of Russia’s home-policy,
against all the rights of peoples. In
the middle of the last century, she fought
against England, France, and Sardinia, after
having secured the neutrality of Austria and
Prussia. In 1870, her friendly neutrality gave
Prussia the opportunity to crush France.
There is something fateful in her traditional
friendship with Germany. Behind the back of
France, though allied to her, it was towards
Germany that Nicholas II. felt himself attracted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
(see his correspondence with William
II., published in Bourtzeff’s paper <i>L’Avenir</i>,
1917), as well as his ministers Sturmer and
Protopopoff, unmasked in the speech of P.
Miliukoff in the Imperial Douma, in February,
1917; M. Miliukoff himself (<i>Pages Modernes</i>,
April number, 1919, page 6); and the Tzar’s
General Skoropadsky; and Lenin and Trotsky
who signed peace with Germany of the Kaiser
and wanted an alliance with Germany of
Scheidemann at any cost. At heart, M. Mandelstam
also is not too remote from this fatal
leaning. He threatens war if the Paris Conference
shows itself disposed to recognise the
independence of the States detached from
Russia (<i>Some Reflections on the Question of a
Great Poland and the Shores of the Baltic</i>, p.
10; <i>Memorandum on the Delimitation of the
Rights of States and Nations</i>, p. 81). With
what war and in alliance with whom does
M. Mandelstam threaten us?</p>

<p>It is evident that the Russian Political
Conference is not free from that fatal inclination.
Its representative, M. Sazonoff, former
Minister, is revealed by Prince Lichnovsky
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
as ready to abandon France, “Russia’s
cherished ally,” to Germany for plunder, on
condition that the latter consents to give
Russia a free hand in regard to Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>It is also very interesting to notice that the
crusade against the independent States of the
Baltic, preached by M. Mandelstam in Paris,
is put into execution in Latvia by the armies
of General von der Goltz which have upset
the legal Government of Latvia recognised by
England and Japan. The hand of M. Mandelstam,
seeking allies for the crusade against
Latvia, has not remained in the air; von der
Goltz has grasped it enthusiastically. Future
Russia and bygone Germany have met in a
common intrigue against independent Latvia.
Finland, Esthonia, Lithuania, Ukraine and
independent Poland are specks in the eyes of
both; and who can guarantee that the points
of contact will not increase with the lapse of
time?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<h2 id="Russia_as_a_Probable_Destroyer_of"><span class="smcap">Russia as a Probable Destroyer of
the World-Peace</span></h2>

<p>Russia has been and will be an ally too
unsteady to count as a factor of equilibrium
in European politics. Moreover, she is a
troublesome factor, and likely to become
directly or indirectly the instigator of a European
war. In 1904, Russia got herself involved
in war with Japan, which exhausted all
her forces. During a sequence of years, Germany
had her hands completely free in the
East, and it was certainly not Russia’s balancing
forces, but considerations of a quite
different nature, which then prevented Germany
from falling upon France. On three
occasions during the last century Russia’s
leanings towards complete possession of the
Black Sea have served as causes of war; and
in that just ended, Russia’s interests in the
Balkans were the motives for aggression on
the part of Austria and Germany. With
Russia’s reconstitution her leanings towards
possession of the Black Sea and particularly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
the Straits will necessarily revive; this has
already been announced by the “Chairman
of the Slav Congress in Moscow and of the
Russian Conference in London,” M. Briantchaninoff,
with the idea that the mandate of
guardianship over the Dardanelles and Constantinople
should in all justice be entrusted
to nobody but Russia.</p>

<p>M. Briantchaninoff’s opinion is not a mere
accident; we have no reason to regard it as
such. There is no doubt that, in a reconstituted
Russia, by a natural reaction from the
humiliations and outrages suffered by the
country, the nationalist wave will rise very
high. This nationalism will have as its aims
those of militant Slavism. One of these aims
has always been the orthodox Cross towering
over “Haghia-Sophia.” And the Straits were
promised to Russia. M. Sazonoff spoke of
that in the Imperial Douma amidst a storm
of applause. This long-pursued object has
escaped from Russian hands thanks only to
the microbes which made their way into M.
Lenin’s sealed-up carriage. It was almost
reached, and it can be reached. It is necessary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
to try to reach it. Lenin is already no more.
M. Briantchaninoff will be heard with thundering
voice; M. Miliukoff will not be able to
refuse his help, having shown interest in the
Dardanelles during his whole life. M. Sazonoff
has in his hands the Allies’ promises,
which only for a time fell into the hands of
“Comrade” Tchitcherin. Thus the watchword:
“To Constantinople!” And that
means: “To Belgrade! To Athens! To
Bucharest!” and also “To Paris! To London!
To Washington!”</p>

<h2 id="Russias_Policy_in_the_Baltic"><span class="smcap">Russia’s Policy in the Baltic</span></h2>

<p>From the direction of the Baltic Sea, reconstituted
Russia threatens us with another
political danger. This danger comes from the
strange policy Russia has pursued in the
Baltic countries, a policy whose repetition is
revealed by many signs. Feeling instinctively
her administrative incapacity, Russia thus
distinctly shows the effects of the influence of
German elements in the staff of her administrators.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
During all the time of her domination
over these countries, she left full power in the
hands of the Baltic barons who&mdash;except in
some accidental and temporary cases&mdash;have
been the administrators and the real masters
of the land. They took great advantage of this
situation, endeavouring to give the country a
German character. Further, they organised
systematic German colonisation, for the realisation
of which Berlin put large sums at their
disposal. This colonisation took on such vast
proportions and was carried on so openly that
it finally attracted the attention of the Russian
Government itself, which, in order to
paralyse its effects, set up Russian colonisation
in its turn. The latter, however, led to no
results, the Russian peasant not being prepared
for the intensive agricultural methods
adopted in the country. The feelings and
leanings of the Baltic nobility have clearly
shown themselves during the war. It is enough
to remember that they offered to General
Hindenburg a third part of their lands for the
purpose of colonisation. Their leanings were
in perfect accord with the aims of the Pan-Germans,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
of whom many were emigrants
from the Baltic, and who, like Professor
Schiemann and P. Rohrbach, have not been
playing an unimportant part. It is extremely
interesting to observe that these tendencies
have not ceased with the defeat of Germany.
It is known that the Germans have promised
to Latvia energetic assistance against the
Bolsheviki if a right to the land is granted to
all the combatants.</p>

<p>It is certain that after the war there will be
a surplus of population in Germany, and it is
not for nothing that Count Brokdorff-Rantzau
complains in one of his notes that it will be
difficult to find room for this surplus of inhabitants,
as it is probable that the principal
States will close their doors to them. There
is no doubt whatever that a large part of this
excess of population will go over to the Baltic,
where they will find land ready for them and
will be received with open arms by the Baltic
barons of Pan-German mind. The Russian
Government, as past experience has proved,
will be unable to oppose this fresh <i>Drang
nach Osten</i>, and if the Lettish people do not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
possess enough freedom of action, that is to
say, if there is no independent Latvia, one can
be supremely sure that German influence will
be very great. On the other hand, the resolution
of the various Landestags, Landesrats,
and Regentschaftsrats, which have asked
for the closest <i>rapprochement</i> with Germany,
militarily and economically, and have offered
the ducal crown to the Hohenzollern dynasty,
leaves no doubt about the direction in which
the sympathies of the Baltic Germans will go.
The Baltic is, in the hands of Russia, a borderland
with predominant German interests, a
land to which Germany stretches out her hand,
a land always ready, at a moment favourable to
Pan-Germanism, to detach itself from Russia
and pass over to the side of her adversaries.
Thus, to be logical in the matter of the Baltic
States, one must decide, not between Russia
and Latvia, but between the latter and Germany.</p>

<p>And thus the argument of political motives
leads to a conclusion which is not at all to the
advantage of Russia’s reconstitution. For
the re-establishment of equilibrium in European
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
politics, Russia is of no value. She is
not, to that end, something which should be
invented if she did not exist.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<h2 id="The_Political_Role_of_the_New_States"><span class="smcap">The Political R&ocirc;le of the New States</span></h2>

<p>In order to have an absolutely clear idea of
the question, it is still necessary to look at
the other side; <i>i.e.</i>, to represent to oneself
the probable policy of the States detached
from Russia. We have already shown that one
cannot expect aggression from these States,
because of the relative external weakness of
them individually. It is equally unimaginable
that they should form an aggressive
alliance, for one cannot realise a common
aggressive aim for all these States. Consequently
one cannot expect a violation of peace
from their side.</p>

<p>But taking into account their relative
weakness, will these States not be subject to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
envy and aggression on the part of their
stronger neighbours, and will they not in this
way, against their will, be the cause of disturbing
the peace? It is necessary to envisage this
peril, but it is possible to avert it. In this one
may rightly rely on the League of Nations
in which the small nations put all their
hope.</p>

<p>Assuredly, the League of Nations is just now
not strong enough; but, in view of the general
national exhaustion, one cannot expect, as
soon as peace is concluded, aggression against
the States which have the authority of the
Peace Conference on their side. If aggressive
forces gather later, the League of Nations will
have had time in the interval to organise
itself definitely and to command moral and
material strength sufficient to check aggression.</p>

<p>There is another way, too, of guaranteeing
the security of the new States: an alliance
between them, or at least between those of
them which have access to the Baltic Sea;
viz., Finland, Esthonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
Poland, and probably White-Russia, an alliance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
with many certain chances of development
in one direction or another. Assuredly,
there are still ancient accounts to be settled
between some of these nations, but common
and vital interests are so strong that History
will be no obstacle in the matter. All these
nationalities have always had continual relations
with Western civilisation, and there
would quickly and easily be formed between
them a community of intellectual and moral
interests. The economic intercourse between
them is also capable of vast development.
For instance, Poland can supply all the other
States with her coal, and Lithuania can supply
the corn which Finland needs. Undoubtedly,
there are common interests between all the
above-named States in the trade of the Baltic
Sea. Each one of them has a natural <i>Hinterland</i>,
and, consequently, is vitally interested
in the guarantee of freedom of trade in the
Baltic Sea. Besides, the mere political interest
of common defence is a strong enough basis
for an alliance of all the Baltic States, for they
are under the double menace of Germany on
one side and Russia on the other. All these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
States have experienced in fact the gravity
of this menace, and so all will understand the
great value of this defensive alliance.</p>

<h2 id="The_Dominium_Maris_Baltici"><span class="smcap">The Dominium Maris Baltici</span></h2>

<p>(Command of the Baltic Sea) has been for
centuries a bone of contention between the
Northern and Eastern States of Europe. For
this the Teutons have contended, and Poland,
Lithuania, Sweden, Denmark, Russia. Germany
had the same aim, and before the war
had nearly reached it. During the whole of
history, every State which acquired strength
and authority in the North or East of Europe,
evinced this inevitable leaning towards possession
of the Baltic Sea, and it was only in the
measure of its success in that direction that
it could play its part as a Great Power, a r&ocirc;le
which ceased the moment the State was
deprived of that <span class="smcap">Dominium Maris Baltici</span>.
To give it again to one of the coastwise States
would mean a fresh menace to the peace of
Europe; but by putting it into the hands of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
those to whom it belongs by natural right,
that is to say, into the common possession of
the States surrounding that sea, one would
remove one of the causes of probable conflicts
in the future of Europe.</p>

<h2 id="Line_of_Partition_Between_Russia_and"><span class="smcap">Line of Partition Between Russia and
Germany</span></h2>

<p>For yet another reason the Baltic States,
or rather their alliance, will have a great r&ocirc;le
to play&mdash;that of a boundary line of economic
and political culture between Russia and Germany.
This partition&mdash;which might be called
a <i>cordon sanitaire</i>&mdash;is absolutely indispensable.
Germany’s direct influence on Russia, with
no obstacle between them, is a real danger.
To the na&iuml;ve and dreamy soul of the childlike
Russian villagers, the extreme sociological
theories of the West, born from a very
complex economic situation, are a direct
temptation and a dangerous poison, as illustrated
by M. Lenin’s sealed railway carriage.
The teachings of German Social Democracy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
have taken such root in Russian soil and have
produced such a harvest that it has caused
much merriment to the Teuton Field-Marshals;
while to Russia it has brought extreme
abasement and almost irretrievable disaster.</p>

<p>And this is likely to happen again, everywhere
and always, whenever a backward race,
neighbour of another highly developed, would
fain borrow from the latter and put into
immediate operation “the latest advances of
civilisation.”</p>

<p>It is the same in regard to economic relations.
Germany, deprived of her colonies,
and lacking sufficient resources in raw materials
and rich markets, will necessarily direct
the surplus of her economic energy towards
Russia, which will easily become a German
colony and submit entirely to German influence.
In this respect, Germany had already
arrived at considerable results before the war.
She will work in the same direction, and after
the signing of peace with still greater activity,
which will assuredly lead to results hardly
desirable from the political point of view.
A Russia invaded by capital and technical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
forces from Germany, and a Germany with
Russian raw materials and Russia’s market
at her disposal, will be such great economic
powers that each will separately appear a
serious menace, and all the more so if in
alliance.</p>

<p>But what is more clear and more important
is the line of political partition between Germany
and Russia. The political security of
Europe used to be constantly under the
menace of an alliance between Russia and
Germany, an alliance which would have
radically destroyed the balance of power.
This menace was in no way artificial but perfectly
real, and might have been realised at
any moment. As we have tried to prove, it
will inevitably reappear with the reconstitution
of Russia. The vanquished two of this
great war will not at once submit to their
fate; both will be discontented and will
cogitate ways of improving their situation.
This alone is a sufficient basis for a <i>rapprochement</i>
or an alliance. Russia will not
resist for long the temptation of an alliance
with Germany, of which the leaders beyond
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
the Rhine are already openly talking. Consequently,
it is necessary to separate Russia
from Germany, that is, to prevent their direct
union, and to that end it would be impossible
to find a more adequate and easy means than
the <i>cordon sanitaire</i> of the States named.
Truth to tell, it would be necessary to invent
this alliance if it did not force itself into being.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><span class="smcap">Conclusion</span></h2>

<p>We have arrived at the end of this study
and may now summarise.</p>

<p>The question of the organisation of the
Lettish people in an independent State must
be decided quickly and definitely. The restoration
of anything whatever of the <i>status
quo ante</i>, whether <i>de facto</i>, temporary or
indefinite, would serve no purpose because it
would not give to the Lettish people the
juridical basis necessary to the reconstruction
of a ruined life. This question must be solved
independently of the will of the Russian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
people, because, in principle, the idea that
the destiny of any people whatsoever depends
on the will of another people, is inadmissible;
because also it is impossible to foresee when
the Russian people will be in a position to
make its will freely known. In definitely
deciding the destiny of Latvia, it is necessary
to reject the project of an All-Russian
Federation.</p>

<p>Such a federation is impossible. In accordance
with the laws of historical continuity, it
is impossible to pass from a centralised State
to one of the most complicated and most
delicate forms of State organisation. Besides,
the peoples of Russia have no such community
of intellectual, moral and economic interests
as might become the solid foundation of a free
co-existence in one and the same State. The
All-Russian Federation will either divide
itself into different States or change itself
into a centralised State in which the natural
rights of its different peoples will not be guaranteed.
The only just solution of the question
of Latvia is the recognition of that country as
an independent State.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>This is not only the natural right of the
Lettish people. It has long been the object of
its permanent and definite leanings, and these
are in harmony with its well-recognised
interests.</p>

<p>The interests of Russia will in no way
suffer from the separation of Latvia; neither
economically, for Latvia will certainly be a
better intermediary between the West and
the East than Russia was or would be; nor
strategically, for Latvia will be a much more
conscientious sentinel on the Baltic Sea than
Russia was or would be.</p>

<p>It is impossible for Russia to claim to re-enter
her former boundaries on the necessity
of European balance of power, for, as a factor
of equilibrium, Russia has been found wanting,
and one can foresee her future complete submission
to the economic and political influence
of Germany, as well as to her civilisation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the interests of a lasting
peace demand the creation of a series of independent
national States for the peoples inhabiting
the shores of the Baltic Sea; and,
between them, a defensive alliance for which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
there are sufficient grounds in the shape of
common economic, political and intellectual
interests. Such an alliance would play at the
same time the r&ocirc;le of the necessary line of
demarcation between Russia and Germany.
Moreover, it is the only natural solution of the
problem of the <i>Dominium maris Baltici</i>, which
has been an apple of discord for centuries and
has often been the disturber of the world’s
peace.

 As fear has big eyes, even among fearless people like
M. Savinkoff, it is believed, for instance, that this latter
gentleman has found in the Bolshevik lines two divisions
of Lettish Rifles, <i>i.e.</i>, 60,000 men (<i>Pages Modernes</i>, No. 1,
page 7). If we take into account that many Letts have
fought from the beginning in the ranks of the Czeko-Slovaks,
in the army of Denikin and in that of the North,
and remembering that the Lettish regiments have
suffered great losses during the war, one can only ask
with amazement where this great number of Lettish
youths comes from. No more than 3,500 Letts can be
counted among the Bolsheviki, all the rest are a vision
inspired by fear.</p></div>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
